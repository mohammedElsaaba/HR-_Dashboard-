## Project Objectives
The dashboard aims to answer the following key questions:
1. Are high-performing employees rewarded with fair salaries?
2. Do high-performing employees receive deserved promotions?
3. Are there departments suffering from lower salaries compared to others?
4. What is the employee turnover rate across departments?

## Main Analyses
1. **Performance vs Salary** *(Scatter Plot)*
   - Weak correlation found (RÂ² = 0.0006).
   - Some low performers earn higher salaries than high performers.

2. **Promotions vs Performance** *(Column Chart)*
   - High performers are generally promoted, but exceptions exist.
   - 14.1% of high performers (rating 4-5) weren't promoted.
   - 21.7% of low performers (rating 1-2) were promoted.

3. **Turnover Rate per Department** *(Pie Chart)*
   - Highest turnover rates observed in Marketing, IT, and other specific departments.
   - Overall turnover rate: **49.6%**.

4. **Average Salary by Department** *(Column Chart)*
   - Salary disparities exist between departments even with similar performance levels.

5. **Promotion Eligibility (Pivot Table)**
   - Employees eligible for promotion based on performance and tenure are identified.

## Key Findings
- Salary does not consistently reflect performance.
- Promotion policies need better alignment with employee performance.
- Certain departments lag in salary averages compared to others.
- High turnover rates may indicate internal issues in specific departments.

---

## Recommendations
1. Reassess salary policies to ensure fairness across departments.
2. Improve the promotion system to better reflect true performance.
3. Monitor departmental turnover and investigate underlying causes.
4. Enhance transparency in reward and compensation structures.
